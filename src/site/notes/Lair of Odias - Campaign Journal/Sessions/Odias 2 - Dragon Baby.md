# Session Events
- Lord [[Ferran Claver\|Ferran Claver]] blocks the exit from the dwarven fortress beneath the Lair of Odias. He insists the party give him the newly-hatched baby dragon for safe-keeping, and says he'll let them live if they do so. 
- The clanging of armor and weapons signals someone is coming. Claver changes his mind and insists that the party leave with the baby dragon and hide in the mountains. He warns [[Annie\|Annie]] not to give the dragon to [[Enric Vall del Drac\|Enric Vall del Drac]], as the prince will "torture her," and threatens [[Kaspar\|Kaspar]] to not harm even a single scale on the dragon. As the party escapes, Claver caves in the room behind them. 
- The party escapes into the snowy mountains outside the Lair. The dragon introduces herself in Common. Kaspar is clearly uncomfortable, while [[Aenryn\|Aenryn]] is dead-set on loving her. [[Katsu\|Katsu]] teaches the dragon to swear.
- After much deliberation, the party settles on naming the baby dragon [[Ophelara\|Ophelara]], the Bright -- or just Ophie for short. Katsu ruins a whole set of rations trying to feed her. Kaspar goes hunting for deer and is not particularly successful.
