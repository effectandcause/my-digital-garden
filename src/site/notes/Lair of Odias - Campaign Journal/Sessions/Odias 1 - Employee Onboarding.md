> The party meets for their first day of employee orientation at the Lair of Odias. The slightly awkward festivities are interrupted by a cave-in trapping them in an ancient dwarven fortress beneath the excavation site. While exploring for a way out, the party discovers an intact dragon egg -- which hatches into a baby silver dragon.
# Session Events
- At onboarding day, the party is introduced by the associate director of the Royal Office of Antiquities, an overly enthusiastic harengon named Arla. Antoinette Vireo, a.k.a. [[Annie\|Annie]], has been hired as the lead educational guide. [[Kaspar\|Kaspar]] Gernot has been hired to work security. [[Aenryn\|Aenryn]] is on the expedition team, and [[Katsu\|Katsu]] is working facilities maintenance. Many awkward icebreakers ensue.
- During onboarding, Prince [[Enric Vall del Drac\|Enric Vall del Drac]] is visiting, along with the party's boss at the Royal Head of Antiquities, [[Ferran Claver.\|Ferran Claver.]] Enric recognizes Annie and is quite friendly with her. We learn that Enric's siblings died in an animal attack. Ferran seems surprised that Kaspar is working here, given their uncle is a famous dragon hunter. 
- Our tour of the facilities is interrupted by a cave-in that traps the party in the unexcavated part of the facilities, which were built atop an old dwarven fortress. The party explores the facilities looking for a way out, discovering that the dwarves who once resided here were worshippers of Moradin, the dwarven creator god.
- Upon discovering an ancient dwarven healing fountain, we learn about the party's favorite drinks. Annie tastes hot chocolate with marshmallows. Aenryn tastes very strong coffee. Katsu attempts to steal from the fountain and tastes pickling juice, his least favorite (and later, hibiscus tea when he follows the rules)
- #battle In a small church to Moradin, the party is attacked by giant rats. Kaspar proves his combat prowess and earns Katsu's respect. Aenryn gets bit. 
- Deep within the dwarven fortress, the party uncovers an ancient dragon nest, with a single silvery-blue dragon egg -- both undisturbed for a very long time. The egg hatches into a baby silver dragon, who imprints on Katsu.
- The party's deliberation about what to do about the whole "first baby dragon in 250 years" thing is interrupted by the reappearance of Ferran Claver, who demands we put down the dragon and leave, "and he'll let us live."
